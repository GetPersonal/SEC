SEC Project Part 3 Report

Design
Our project works with 4 server replicas, accepting only one byzantine fault.
On storing the public key block the client stores all server answers it receives
and checks if it has a quorum (N-f) < (N+f)/2
 

Optimizations
There are no optimizations regarding number of replicas for hash blocks.
